# Learning Objectives
  You will learn: 
  
  * Fasics of FHIR as a data model for public health use cases and digital health solutions
  * How to develop a FHIR questinnnaire from existing paper form and use clinical terminology
  * How to integrate Structure Data Capture into your applications
  * How to display a Questionnaire
  * How to get answers as a QuestionnaireResponse
  * How to extract FHIR resrouces from a QuestionnaireResponse
  * How to Setup HAPI FHIR Server
  * How to sync a mobile app with a FHIR Server
  * How to set-up and configure analytics pipeline and a basic dashboard

# Public Health Use Cases
  We have prioritized the following public health use cases for the bootcamp activities. Please select one of these to develop FHIR questionnaires from existing paper forms, or feel free to use an existing use case of your own for the learning journey. 
  
## Immunization
  The Immunization Program in the Philippines faces significant challenges and risks that hinder its effectiveness. Fragmented systems and inadequate infrastructure create inefficiencies, while human resource shortages and skills gaps exacerbate operational issues. Political will and funding shortages undermine     
 sustainability and planning efforts. Digital tools, such as eLMIS, remain underutilized due to low awareness, advocacy, and acceptance, compounded by misinformation and lack of education. Geographically isolated areas face additional barriers, and a lack of ICT equipment, digital health strategies, and regulatory frameworks further impede progress. Risks include data security threats, natural disasters, armed conflict, leadership changes, economic instability, and sudden outbreaks, which strain resources and disrupt program continuity.

## Maternal Health
  The Maternal Health Program in the Philippines faces significant challenges in implementing digital solutions. Fragmented information systems, limited capacity for system enhancements, and difficulties in collecting accurate maternal and child health data hinder progress. Cultural resistance among users and employees and policy gaps in health digitalization slow the transition to digital systems. Harmonizing varying levels of digitalization across agencies and addressing weak data collection capacity require substantial human, financial, and infrastructural resources. Risks include data-sharing refusals due to security, privacy, ethical, and legal concerns, alongside susceptibility to data breaches, threatening collaboration and the effective use of digital health solutions.

## Nutrition
  The Nutrition Program in the Philippines encounters numerous challenges and risks in leveraging digital health solutions. Issues with data aggregation, quality, and interoperability hinder effective analysis and decision-making. Fragmented systems, varying definitions, and inconsistent compliance across agencies and local governments complicate efforts. Human resource mobilization, capacity building, and stakeholder buy-in remain critical gaps. Limited funding for ICT tools and infrastructure, alongside rapid turnover in inter-agency committees, further impede progress. Risks include cybersecurity and data privacy concerns, reluctance of stakeholders to interoperate, and the absence of clear governance or leadership at the national level, jeopardizing coordination and program sustainability.
